        "<p align=\"justify\"> In this notebook, we demonstrate a basic workflow that serves as a foundation for the challenge. The model has been developed to predict <b>water quality parameters</b> using features derived from the <b>Landsat</b> and <b>TerraClimate</b> datasets. Specifically, four spectral bands—<b>SWIR22</b> (Shortwave Infrared 2), <b>NIR</b> (Near Infrared), <b>Green</b>, and <b>SWIR16</b> (Shortwave Infrared 1)—were utilized from Landsat, along with derived spectral indices such as <b>NDMI</b> (Normalized Difference Moisture Index) and <b>MNDWI</b> (Modified Normalized Difference Water Index). In addition, the <b>PET</b> (Potential Evapotranspiration) variable was incorporated from the <b>TerraClimate</b> dataset to account for climatic influences on water quality. </p>\n",
        "\n",
        "<p align=\"justify\"> The dataset spans a five-year period from <b>2011 to 2015</b>. Using <b>API-based data extraction</b> methods, both Landsat and TerraClimate features were retrieved directly from the <a href=\"https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/\">Microsoft Planetary Computer</a> portal. These combined spectral, index-based, and climatic features were used as predictors in a regression model to estimate three key water quality parameters: <b>Total Alkalinity (TA)</b>, <b>Electrical Conductance (EC)</b>, and <b>Dissolved Reactive Phosphorus (DRP)</b>.\n",
        "\n",
        "</p> <p align=\"justify\"> Please note that this notebook serves only as a starting point. Several assumptions were made during the data extraction and model development process, which you may find opportunities to improve upon. Participants are encouraged to explore additional features, enhance preprocessing techniques, or experiment with different regression algorithms to optimize predictive performance. </p>"
